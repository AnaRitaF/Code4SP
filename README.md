	<h1>Code4SP</h1> This project aims at transferring the "CodeDoor Best Practice" - transfer of computer programming (coding)
	skills to people from vulnerable socio-economic groups. Coding is a hard skill that is currently limited and highly paid
	on the labor market; the new "Coding experts" join the labor market with high success: Over 90% of the CodeDoor's alumni
	have been able to find a job or an apprenticeship in the last four years or have set up their own start-ups, and many CodeDoor
	alumni act as mentors for the new generation.
	<p>This good-practice is self-sustainable for two motives: </p>


	<p> 1. The benefit that the alumni bring to the coding talent seekers is so high that the enterprises are interested in
		supporting the perpetuation of this good practice by allocating resources or funds. The alumni suddenly find themselves
		in such a higher socio-economic position that many feel the moral need to support the perpetuation of the good-practice
		by volunteering to provide on-line coding expert support to the current CodeDoor trainees. This support is usually provided
		through the use of specialized support forums/platforms.</p>


	<p> 2. This CodeDoor Best Practice has been implemented locally in different towns in Germany and constantly evolving for
		improvement. In this project, this good-practice will be adapted and transferred to Mediterranean countries. The countries
		under focus (Greece, Portugal, and Cyprus) were chosen due to their high youth unemployment rate (above 20%) and the lowest
		ICT experts' rates in the national job markets – thus suggesting an increased need for ICT experts. Code4SP project is
		expected to impact the socio-economic promotion of the participants and their communities and create role models on socio-economic
		promotion through VET and the economic valorization of the local enterprises due to the recruitment of Coding experts.</p>

    <p> SPEL means “Society for the Promotion of School Establishments”. It was founded in 1990, by a group of experienced teachers, who wanted to create schools that would not only teach the students but also assist them psychologically and socially. Therefore, they created a school for VET and they strategically located it in a region of high unemployment and social problems. Its focus is the students, which traditionally demand an out-of-the-box approach to teaching; therefore, SPEL integrates various out-of-the classroom dynamics in the teaching process. Since Mathematics is a traditionally challenging topic to teach in out of classroom environment, SPEL has a high interest in implementing the results of the project. </p>

It aims to integrate people that belong to socially vulnerable groups (refugees/migrants/unemployed Greeks and in the future, people with disabilities), in the Greek society. For SHA, social inclusion and solidarity are quite important values that they want to bring in their local community, by educating youth less-skilled in digital skills, in order to enjoy equal opportunities in the job market, and integrate in the society. SHA has decided to strive for its mission, by educating those groups, in a sector that is in high demand in the market industry today. This sector is software engineering, including the know-how and expertise on building websites and Internet Applications. Through capitalizing on tech education, as a tool, it aims to bridge the gap between the lack of digital skill-set among Greek human workforce and the high unemployment rates in European Union, in order to enable them to acquire job placements, in IT Industry. </p>
